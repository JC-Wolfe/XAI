# Scripts for "An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach for Decoding the enhancer histone modifications code and identification of novel enhancers in Drosophila"

Scripts used to construct tiled genomes for BG3 and S2 cell that are used to train XAI models on the TEMENOS XAI platform to predict enhancers.
The results of the bulk inference of these models across the entire genome are then filtered and explored.
